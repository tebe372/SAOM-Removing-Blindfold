title: "Visualizing the CTMC and SAOM fitting process"
output: github_document

This outline exists to help me get my thoughts straight with respect to my process of visualizing the SAOM fitting process and the underlying CTMC for network change. Why am I doing this? What am I going to do? What have I already done? What do I want to accomplish? 

# Outline

1. Visualize the CTMC
    a. Why? - to better understand the model. to see what's going on underneath. to see how the objective function affects tie changes.
    b. How? - write a function to simulate from time 1 to time 2 given parameter values that stores the network at each step, the time between each step, and any covariate values. visualize the one-tie-at-a-time changes in a movie, facets, any other way. use color or shape changes to see how the covariate levels affect the changes.
    c. What? - this will become part of the "removing the blindfold" chapter. introduction and first sections
2. Visualize the fitting process
    a. Why? - to better understand the updating process. to see what's influencing the parameter estimates most. 
    b. How? - write a function that mimics the `RSiena` fitting process for Method of Moments OR figure out how to extract the parameter updates from the `sienafit` object. visualize the chains of parameter changes. look at how different parameter values for starting values affect the estimations.
    c. What? - this will become part of the "removing the blindfold" chapter. Maybe model-in-data-space section.
