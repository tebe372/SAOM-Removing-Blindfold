To do list for this paper
================

Don't spend any time placing the figures!!!!! Place figure just in front of the paragraph of text describing it.

Broadly
-------

-   \[X\] Write an abstract - Gelman method/sanity check. First sentence of every paragraph of the intro & the very last sentence of intro.
-   \[ \] Submit to journal
-   \[X\] Spacing around figures WAY to large above/below captions - change fig.height for coord\_fixed figures
-   \[X\] Make axes labels and text larger in figures
-   \[X\] Make labels of points larger
-   \[X\] Reverse order of x-y axes on adjmat vizs

Introduction
------------

-   \[X\] Proof read

Section 2
---------

-   \[X\] Proof read
-   \[X\] Make sure I've defined ego/alter nodes
-   \[X\] Need to talk about the CTMC, rest of the SAOM model definition after the objective function discussion.

Section 3
---------

-   \[X\] Proof read
-   \[X\] Finish section 3.1 (elaborate on probability)
-   \[ \] Beef up transition after sect. 3.1.3

Section 4
---------

-   \[X\] Add another example of a data set for M-in-DS (Sect 4.1) (Congress)
-   \[ \] Make node-link gif available online
-   \[ \] Insert link to full node-link gif in paper
-   \[ \] Make adjmat gif available online
-   \[ \] Insert link to full adjmat gif in paper
-   \[ \] Beef up transition before Sect 4.4
-   \[X\] Figure 6: reverse order of adjacency matrix y-axis
-   \[X\] Figure 5: get rid of Vs on node labels, make font bigger
-   \[X\] Figure 7 not showing up??
-   \[X\] Fix error on p. 21 (probably related to above)
-   \[X\] Heatmap p 23 missing caption
-   \[X\] Describe Figure 8 more. What is going on??
-   \[X\] Add geomnet example in 4.2
-   \[X\] p. 26-28 figure refs & code is broken
-   \[X\] Get rid of repeated plot p 29
-   \[X\] p. 34 code is broken
-   \[X\] General proof reading
