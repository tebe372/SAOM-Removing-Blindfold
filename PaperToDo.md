To do list for this paper
================

Don't spend any time placing the figures!!!!! Place figure just in front of the paragraph of text describing it.

Broadly
-------

-   \[ \] Write an abstract
-   \[ \] Submit to journal
-   \[ \] Spacing around figures WAY to large above/below captions
-   \[ \] Make axes labels and text larger in figures
-   \[ \] Make labels of points larger

Introduction
------------

-   \[ \] Proof read

Section 2
---------

-   \[ \] Proof read
-   \[X\] Make sure I've defined ego/alter nodes
-   \[ \] Need to talk about the CTMC, rest of the SAOM model definition after the objective function discussion.

Section 3
---------

-   \[ \] Proof read
-   \[ \] Finish section 3.1 (elaborate on probability)

Section 4
---------

-   \[ \] Add histogram of number of tie changes from *t*<sub>1</sub> to *t*<sub>2</sub> in simulations
-   \[ \] Add another example of a data set for M-in-DS (Sect 4.1) (Congress)
-   \[ \] Make gif available online
-   \[ \] Insert link to full gif in paper
-   \[X\] Figure 6: reverse order of adjacency matrix y-axis
-   \[ \] Figure 5: get rid of Vs on node labels, make font bigger
-   \[X\] Figure 7 not showing up??
-   \[X\] Fix error on p. 21 (probably related to above)
-   \[X\] Heatmap p 23 missing caption
-   \[ \] Describe Figure 8 more. What is going on??
-   \[ \] Add geomnet example in 4.2
-   \[X\] p. 26-28 figure refs & code is broken
-   \[X\] Get rid of repeated plot p 29
-   \[X\] p. 34 code is broken
-   \[ \] General proof reading

Discussion
----------

-   \[ \] Write up conclusions
-   \[ \] Discuss future work
